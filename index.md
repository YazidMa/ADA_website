## What Trump said and what people thought about him from 2015 to 2020

# Abstract

In 2016, the world was completely astonished: Donald Trump was elected president while all the surveys done until this moment estimated Hillary Clinton winner. The four following years were marked by shocking declarations on Twitter, controversies, and withdrawal from previous agreements. But even if this president had been highly criticized by a part of the international community, he was almost ready to run a second term on 2020. In order to understand better how Donald Trump brought support to his cause, two main parameters must be studied: what was his program before and after his nomination, and how his popularity rating evolved among time.


# Introduction

Three main questions guided this study.
About Trump's program:
-  What were the topics Donald Trump talked about most during the presidential campaign (starting in 2015), and during his time in office (20/01/2017 - 20/01/2021)? Indeed, before looking for Trump's support, we have to understand what he had to offer to his supporters. But studying his official agenda was not as accurate as one could thought, as most of the time, official agendas are "perfect" and should not represent the real thoughts of a candidate. On the contrary, looking for topics that appeared in Trump's quotes over time is much more telling about the goal he pursued. Then, the aim was to look for change over time, for example before and after his election, or because of external events such as the Covid crisis.

About Trump' supporters and opponents:
- Can we quantify Trump's popularity over time? This time, instead of looking for topics in quotes, the idea is to establish whether a quote is in favor or against Trump's policies. Once again, the evolution over time could be linked to external events. Another aspect is the ethnicity of the persons, as Trump's speeches and policies rekindled tensions with minorities.
- In which newspapers are Trump's quotations published? One of the key event of the 2016 campaign was the massive use of both fake news by Russia to discredit Hillary Clinton and tweets to be present on social media. This campaign appears to be a mediatic battle, in which newspapers played a great role. Different information can be provided by this study, as the relation between political affiliation of a newspaper and the positivity of the Trump's quotes it published.

# Method
 
To answer the questions, we needed data. The one we use were extracted by an method described in _Quotebank: A Corpus of Quotations from a Decade of News_ (mettre une référence un peu plus propre ?). Briefly, quotations were extracted from English articles, and their authors were estimated by the program with a confidence value. As the quotation corpus is huge (178 million quotations), the data had to be process smartly to prevent computers from crashing. For that reason, only the data from 2015 to 2020 were selected (one year before Trump's election until the end of his term). Furthermore, only the remaining quotations from Trump or talking about Trump in English were kept. After this preprocessing step, only 1,097,729 quotes remained, which is not negligeable.

# Results

## Trump's main topics over time

More than all other presidents, Trump published many ideas on Twitter, that are then quoted by newspaper. For that reason, most of his ideas are available in our database. To extract them, we just had to consider only the quotations whose author is Trump. At this point, the operation became a bit more complicated: how determine the topics in Trump's quotations? We decided to use [insert the method used], which briefly [insert the mode of action of the methodo used]. The topics were classified into [insert the names of the categories], whose repartition over time is shown below.

[insert the repartition over time of the Trump's topics]

[insert the analysis of the graph above]

THOMAS POUR TON ANALYSE:
- foreign policy: le pic en 2017 correspond probablement à la crise avec la Corée du Nord (corroboré par le fait que ce soit un des plus gros mots du nuage). Celui de 2018 pourrait être lié à la crise avec le Pakistan (les mots Pakistan et Afghanistan sont gros dans le nuage), Trump tweetant en janvier que le Pakistan rewarded US aid with "nothing but lies and deceit". Il trouvait que les Pakistanais ne luttaient pas assez contre les Talibans à leur frontière avec l'Afghanistan, ce qui favoriserait selon lui le terrorisme. Le ppic de 2019 pourrait correspondre à l'affaire ukrainienne, puisqu'en septembre 2019, un lanceur d'alerte révèle que Trumpa demandé au président ukrainien de faire une enquête sur le fils de Joe Biden
- racism je n'ai pas trouvé grand chose, surtout que les mots qui resortent le plus sont en lien avec la religiion plus que le reacisme. A noter qu'apparemment, Trump utilise presque 2 fois plus de mots faisant référence directement à Dieu que n'importe quel autre président de ces 100 dernières années pour se mettre les milieux religieux dans la poche, ce qui pourrait expliquer le pic en 2016 juste avant l'élection. Le pic de 2015 pourrait s'expliquer par la mort de Freddie Gray (Trump a en effet commenté l'affaire) mais peu de mots du nuage de mots sont en rapport avec l'affaire.
- economy: il en parle bcp pendant sa campagne puis peu après ce qui semble logique. Pendant toute la campagne il a clamé que la Chine hurts the American economy by devaluating the yuan.
- environnement: probablement pas grand chose puisque Trump a préféré agir dans l'ombre, supprimant 68 lois environnementales en toute discrétion
- pandemic c'est bien sûr le Corona
- ne pas oublier de dire que Trump ne parle pas d'éducation ni de je ne sais plus quoi

## Trump's popularity

### Trump's popularity in the population

During all its political involvement, Trump's was described as a divisive figure. The controversies he created reinforced the adhesion of a part of the population, and reinforced the opposition of the other part. But is this trend visible in quotes from people talking about Trump? The first step was to select only the quotes talking about Trump (means that the quote author is not Trump, but that the word "Trump" appears in the quote). Then, we applied Vader for sentiment analysis. This method allows to determine the degree of posity of a quote, so applying it on the whole dataframe allows to determine the posity of all the quotes. The posity is given by a number, called the compound, between -1 and 1. The closer to 1, the more positive the quotation, the closer to -1, the more negative. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91223105/146353122-599f8468-a6e5-4a50-96a0-57b59af39973.png)


One of the first trend we see while looking at this graph is that the peaks are strongly correlated [TODO statistical test?] with small number of quotes for this period of time. To reduce the variance, we decided to group the quotes on a 6 month time window instead of only one month.

<p align="center">
   <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91223105/146196478-c876ed0b-a223-492d-97d1-857495fdbf79.png" width="900" />
</p>
 
This is quite better, the fluctuations are not correlated with the number of quotes anymore! To be sure that our result is in accordance with the reality, we compared our results with a graph of the Trump's popularity rating over time.

[insert, on the same graph, the popularity rating and the previous graph]

[insert comments on the graph above]

Plotting over months can hide general trends over years.

<p align="center">
   <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91223105/146194929-20d9242b-d880-4424-b2c6-8dcd83db9dea.png" width="400" />
</p>

It appears that Trump's popularity decreased from 0.22 to 0.15 between 2015 and 2019, meaning a 7% decrease in 4 years. Between 2019 and 2020, his popularity increased to reach 0.19, but this is probably due to the decrease in quotations about Trump, leading to a huge variance in the result (almost 10% against 4% in 2018). As a conclusion, the more time Trump passed in office, the lower his popularity rating.

But is this trend representative of all the American population? Probably not. So to distinguish people that agree or not with Trump policies, we used information provided about the speakers, and especially their ethnicities. Indeed, Trump's term was marked by racial issues like George Floyd death. These problems could have modified the way ethnic groups thought about Trump.

We plotted the mean compound value for several speaker parameters. 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91223105/146354906-630e0c96-3692-42de-b49c-4a9107e815d4.png)

Immediatly, it appears that all the mean value are positive, meaning that, on average, the persons are more quoted when they talk positively about Trump. Of course, this also can be linked with the method used by Vader to determine if a sentence is positive or negative. This can introduce a bias in our study, so  let's take that in mind when analyzing the results. But this can also be explained by the a respect for the presidential function, leading newspapers to be kind while quoting people talking about the president.

The most positive quotations are from North American, European, and Australian people. 

It appears that more men are quoting when talking about Trump than women (7979 against 1747). Moreover, men's quotes are more positive than women's ones.

Here appears one of the most important limit of Vader function: indeed, according to Vader, the ethnic group the more in favor of Trump are the African American, ahead Caucasian. This is clearly not what was showed by the polls between 2015 and 2020. This result could be explain by the will of Conservative newspapers to improve the image of Trump by quoting African Americans in favor of Trump. But this is only an hypothesis which is probably not enough to explain this result. We can also notice that only few Asian and Latino-American people are quoted (respectively 17 and 4).

<p align="center">
   <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91223105/146430504-d3b32371-d097-49a3-b2a7-ca1565161b8c.png" width="400" />
</p>

It is interesting to note that both Republican and Democrat are in favour of Trump. However, as they present a similar mean compound, the explanation is probably the same as before: newspapers only quote person talking with respect of the president, leading to a bias selection of the quotes (considering that people against the president are more likely to be aggressive in their words).

So far, the results are quite counter intuitive (for example, African Americans in favour of Trump while polls during Trump presidential reported 80% of opposition in African American population, or the fact that most parts of the world are in favour of Trump). For that reason, we will compare Vader result with Flair ones. Flair is another pre-trained sentiment analysis method. Contrary to Vader, it only returns “positive” or “negative” while analysing a sentence instead of a compound.
We represented the percentage of negative sentences return by Flair for the previous categories.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91223105/146430800-e17b6b28-1dc6-40d0-81a8-4fd0591c3612.png)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91223105/146430834-77603837-850b-433d-9fc5-e601eaef0f3a.png)

Immediately, it appears that the categories are more opposed to Trump than the Vader ones. This nuances our analysis with Vader where we said that overall the sentiment towards Trump was slightly positive. Vader is an algorithm that is rather optimized for social media data, whereas Flair is an algorithm trained on a dataset with larger topics (more specifically on IMDB dataset which is an online database of information related to films, television series, home videos, video games, and streaming content online). Moreover, Vader is a method that only cares about individual words and completely ignores the context in which it is used, while Flair considers the context. One could therefore think that here the results obtained with Flair are more correct, and this is also more in line with what we expect to get about Trump.
This time, North American, Asian, and African people are more opposed to Trump, while the other parts of the world are quite neutral. This is quite logic, as Trump was hugely criticized abroad.
Women are more opposed to Trump than men who are quite neutral. 
This time, both Democrats and Republicans are against Trump. One might think that we have the symmetric problem than Vader one, as Republican are not supposed to be against Trump. But in fact, Trump was criticized by his own party during his term (and no Democrat enhanced him). So Flair result is more realistic than Vader one.
As a conclusion for the comparison between Vader and Flair, we see that, globally, we find the same difference as before when we compare the labels for a given category (the difference between Democrat and Republican approval is the same with both Vader and Flair). It is rather "reassuring" concerning the results.  The main difference is the absolute positivity value, as Flair is more negative than Vader, which corresponds more to the reality.
These results are overall results from 2015 to 2020. But is there a difference in approval rating after Trump election?

We can see that the opinion before and after the campaign is extremely different with a strong increase of the percentage of negative quotations after the campaign for almost all the categories and labels. We would thus have a much more negative general opinion of Trump after his campaign (i.e. during his presidency), which is rather in line with what we expect to have in reality. However, it should be kept in mind that here there is no error bars, which may qualify the analysis.

### Trump popularity in newspapers

Many newspapers and media have quoted Trump directly or people talking about him since the start of his campaign. Ranking the publishers by the number of quotations in both cases can be informative to assess who is talking about Trump. The following table shows the top 10 publishers along with the number of quotations **about** Trump and the political affiliation.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91223105/146327129-428fc947-2ebf-4061-89b6-713df192c26d.png)

Except for the fact that all of these publishers are based in the United States, we cannot extract any trend from that table. It seems that the political affiliation of the publishers is not correlated with the number of quotations. Conservative, liberal and non-affiliated media all report quotations about Trump. Repeating the procedure with the quotations **from** Trump being used by publishers yields different results.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91223105/146328647-25ec2375-c379-4a33-991c-91cfca260fe3.png)

The first observation is that the number of quotations is much higher, therefore the results can be slightly more trusted. Additionally, it appears that conservative and non-affiliated newspaper quote Trump the most. However, it is not sufficient to clearly state that either the conservative over-promote Trump or that the Liberals do not quote him on purpose. The missing part of the analysis is the actual content of the quotes.

Intuitively, the idea that all publishers quote content related to Donald Trump is not surprising. After all, he was the president of the United States at the time. However, it may seem plausible that the conservative newspapers would depict him more positively than the liberal ones. Conversely, the opposite has been observed, for instance, when Trump withdrew the accreditation of the journalist Jim Acosta and Fox News, a conservative media commonly known to be highly sympathetic towards him, criticized his decision. The sentiment analysis proposed above can be used to assess this hypothesis.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61464628/146427939-cdb3c37a-05da-48cd-ba37-c4708c557dc1.png)

The figure shown above displays the average Vader compound for the top 10 publishers of quotations **about** Trump. At first glance, it appears that liberal media outlets depict a more positive view of Donald Trump through their quotations. The first conservative publisher only appears in the fourth position. However, the confidence intervals shown in black should be taken into account. Indeed, it can be argued that for a slightly different sampling of the newspaper space, the ranking could have been completely different. Again, the same analysis can be performed for quotations **from** Trump.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61464628/146427978-d1374b67-5ab6-4935-8284-2a60a5f0e009.png)

First, it appears that most publishers have a similar score which is very close to the average score on the entire dataset. Again, the highest ranked newspaper is liberal and the the first conservative one ranks four. However, similarly to the previous paragraph, the confidence intervals, even though they are much more narrow, still indicate that the ranking is quite arbitrary. It seems that the quotations from or about Trump are not well correlated with the political affiliation of the publishers who decides to cite them. To get an idea of the big picture, it can be informative to plot the average Vader compound as a function of the number of quotations for the entire dataset, regardless of the political affiliations.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61464628/146428033-59fc19be-42c8-4f56-9788-688bebf10364.png)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61464628/146428045-710a2df9-735f-4829-8cb4-0e92e5c7196b.png)


These figures speak for themselves. It clearly appears that the sentiment associated to the quotations converges to a slightly positive value in both cases. For sure, a region of extreme opinions can be observed in both plots but they correspond to an interval of small number of quotations which is therefore extremely noisy. 

Finally, it seems reasonable to validate the analysis using an another sentiment analysis tool. A similar procedure can be conducted with Flair's predictions by normalizing the number of positive quotations between -1 and 1 for each publishers. Though comparable, this estimator can not be treated as strictly equivalent to the Vader score.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61464628/146428074-352847e5-89cc-4eab-addb-dc8ec7454c56.png)

Even though the mean value is slightly negative this time, a similar pattern as observed above appears: high variance and extreme values in the low number of quotations regime and convergence towards the mean value when the sample size increases. 

In conclusion, the analysis proposed above seems to indicate that the  quotes about and from Trump published by a media is not representative  of its political affiliation. This could be due to respect towards the president or self censorship. Additionally, the  sentiment analysis is probably not perfect, resulting in noisy labels  for which the uncertainty is difficult to characterize. Moreover, it can be observed that the results of this analysis is coherent with the previous section in which we found that the difference between the sentiment analysis of the quotations about Trump were not significant between democrats and republicans. Finally, one could point out that this conclusion is not really surprising as the  sentiment of the quotations about and from a single man, however famous and power he is, is a weak signal: characterizing the affiliation of a publisher based on this estimator sounds like a shortcut and our analysis shows  that it is indeed one.




# Conclusion
