## Evolution of the Trump's popularity and topic from 2015 to 2020
## What Trump said and what people thought about him from 2015 to 2020

# Abstract

In 2016, the world was completely astonished: Donald Trump was elected president while all the surveys done until this moment estimated Hillary Clinton winner. The four following years were marked by shocking declarations on Twitter, controversies, and withdrawal from previous agreements. But even if this president had been highly criticized by a part of the international community, he was almost ready to run a seond term on 2020. In order to understand better how Donald Trump brought support to his cause, two main parameters must be studied: what was his program before and after his nomination, and how his popularity rating evolved among time.


# Introduction

Three main questions guided this study.
About Trump's program:
-  What were the topics Donald Trump talked about most during the presidential campaign (starting in 2015), and during his time in office (20/01/2017 - 20/01/2021)? Indeed, before looking for Trump's support, we have to understand what he had to offer to his supporters. But studying his official agenda was not as accurate as one could thought, as most of the time, official agendas are "perfect" and should not represent the real thoughts of a candidate. On the contrary, looking for topics that appeared in Trump's quotes over time is much more telling about the goal he pursued. Then, the aim was to look for change over time, for example before and after his election, or because of external events such as the Covid crisis.

About Trump' supporters and opponents:
- Can we quantify Trump's popularity over time? This time, instead of looking for topics in quotes, the idea is to establish whether a quote is in favor or against Trump's policies. Once again, the evolution over time could be linked to external events. Another aspect is the ethnicity of the persons, as Trump's speeches and policies rekindled tensions with minorities.
- In which newspapers are Trump's quotations published? One of the key event of the 2016 campaign was the massive use of both fake news by Russia to discredit Hillary Clinton and tweets to be present on social media. This campaign appears to be a mediatic battle, in which newspapers played a great role. Different information can be provided by this study, as the relation between political affiliation of a newspaper and the positivity of the Trump's quotes it published.

# Method
 
To answer the questions, we needed data. The one we use were extracted by an method described in _Quotebank: A Corpus of Quotations from a Decade of News_ (mettre une référence un peu plus propre ?). Briefly, quotations were extracted from English articles, and their authors were estimated by the program with a confidence value. As the quotation corpus is huge (178 million quotations), the data had to be process smartly to prevent computers from crashing. For that reason, only the data from 2015 to 2020 were selected (one year before Trump's election until the end of his term). Furthermore, only the remaining quotations from Trump or talking about Trump in English were kept. After this preprocessing step, only 1,097,729 quotes remained, which is not negligeable.

# Results

## Trump's main topics over time

More than all other presidents, Trump published many ideas on Twitter, that are then quoted by newspaper. For that reason, most of his ideas are available in our database. To extract them, we just had to consider only the quotations whose author is Trump. At this point, the operation became a bit more complicated: how determine the topics in Trump's quotations ? We decided to use [insert the method used], which briefly [insert the mode of action of the methodo used]. The topics were classified into [insert the names of the categories], whose repartition over time is shown below.
